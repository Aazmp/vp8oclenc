# for amd app sdk on windows with default path
g++ vp8enc.cpp entropy_host.cpp -I"<appsdk-include-path>" -L"<appsdk-lib-path>" -lOpenCL -o vp8oclenc

for AMD
default AMD APP SDK path on windows:
C:/Program Files (x86)/AMD APP
on Linux:
/opt/AMDAPP

then it followed by /lib/x86 or /lib/x86_64 for libs
and /include for headers


Also renaming .cpp to .c is ok.
Code is in C, .cpp is just for visual studio, that doesn't have C99 compiler.
